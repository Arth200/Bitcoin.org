<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>
<p>
A Bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 created a large block (height 225,430) that is incompatible with earlier versions of Bitcoin.
</p>
<p>
This resulted in a blockchain fork, with miners, merchants, and users on the new version accepting and building on that block, while those on older versions rejected it and created their own blockchain.
</p>

<h2 id="what-is-being-done">What Is Being Done</h2>
<p>
Large mining pools using version 0.8.0 have been asked to revert to version 0.7 to establish a single blockchain compatible with all Bitcoin software.
</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-do">I'm Not a Miner or a Merchant; What Should I Do?</h3>
<p>
Nothing. Your Bitcoin software will automatically switch to the correct chain, regardless of the version you are using.
</p>

<h3 id="are-my-bitcoins-safe">Are My Bitcoins Safe?</h3>
<p>
Yes, your bitcoins are safe.
</p>

<p>
Core developers have investigated the issues that caused older versions to reject the new blocks and have released version 0.8.1 to prevent the creation of incompatible blocks. <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_50">A full post-mortem document has been published</a>.
